● Conditional Statement:
Conditional Statement make decisions

● Selection / Branch:
A branch is a sequence of statements only 
executed under a certain condition.

● Decision:
Decision is a term in programming which 
determines a Statement


● If-else:
A decision and its two branches are often 
called if-else branches

● If-elseif branches:
A series of decisions appear cascaded in each
decision's false branch, known as if-elseif
branches

● Equality operator:
An equality operator checks whether two 
operand's values are the same(==)or 
different(!=)

● Boolean:
an expression involving an equality operator 
evaluates to a Boolean value. A Boolean is
a type that has just two values: true or false

● Nested branches:
A branch's statements can include any valid 
statements, uncluding another if-else branch, 
known as nested branches.

● Multiple if branches:
In multiple if branches, each decision is 
independent, and thus more than one branch 
can execute, in contrast to the if-else-if
arrangement where only one brnach can execute.
